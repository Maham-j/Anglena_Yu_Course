Global constants are values in a program that are assigned once and never change during the execution of the program. 
They are typically used to represent fixed values that are relevant throughout the codebase.
Using global constants can improve code readability, make it easier to understand the purpose of certain values,
like value of pi and things you never wanted to be changed.it should all be capitalized

PI = 3.14159
